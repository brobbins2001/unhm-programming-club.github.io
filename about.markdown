## Why You Should Join This Club

Our degree is worth what we put into it, what we choose to learn, what connections we strive to make. We can learn a lot in our classes and from our professors, but there are some important things do not get as much classroom time. For one, in class, most programming is done solo. But in a professional setting, we will always be working in a group.

It is to your advantage to build skills that will help you to land a great job and thrive in the professional world. Foremost among those skills are teamwork, organization, and peer programming. Our degree curriculum are limited in how much time they devote to these important areas. This club will fill those gaps and level up those skills as we collaborate on cool projects. It will help us connect with each other and others in the field. It will expose us to new strategies for approaching software development. It will inform us about events, like hackathons, where we can network with professionals in the field. It will expose us to resources and technologies we can add to our arsenal, and provide us experience in the actual languages and libraries employers are looking for their candidates to be proficient in.

It will provide the opportunity to learn invaluable, employment-ready skills not easily acquired by simply attending classes.

# But I'm new to programming!

You don't have to be an expert programmer to join this club. We are all learners. If you have a genuine interest in programming, this is the right place for you. You will benefit from conversing with others who are further along the path, and they will benefit by explaining their approaches.

Even in contributing to group projects, there will be plenty of ways to help that don't involve mastering algorithms.

# What are the membership requirements?

The membership requirements have not yet been finalized. The first meeting of the UNHM Programming Club was held on March 13th, 2021, and we still have to draft and ratify our constitution, elect a full slate of officers, and decide on a faculty advisor before we can become an official UNHM organization.

For now, if you show up to the meeting, you are a member!
